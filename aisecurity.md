AI Security Assessment Service
Overview
Zactonics.ai offers a cutting-edge AI Security Assessment Service designed to safeguard your AI-enabled systems against emerging threats. Leveraging the MITRE ATLAS (Adversarial Threat Landscape for Artificial-Intelligence Systems) framework and the CRISP-ML(Q) lifecycle, our service provides a comprehensive, lifecycle-wide approach to identifying and mitigating vulnerabilities unique to AI systems, such as data poisoning, evasion attacks, and prompt injection.
Why Choose Our AI Security Assessments?
AI systems introduce novel risks that traditional cybersecurity measures may not address. Our service uses the MITRE ATLAS knowledge base to catalog adversarial tactics and techniques, ensuring your systems are protected against attacks like:

Poisoning Attacks: Modifying training data to embed backdoors, compromising model outputs.
Evasion Attacks: Crafting adversarial inputs to elicit incorrect model responses.
Prompt Injection Attacks: Manipulating large language models (LLMs) to bypass instructions.
Functional Extraction: Stealing model functionality through iterative querying.
Inversion Attacks: Extracting sensitive training data to exploit privacy vulnerabilities.

By integrating ATLAS with the CRISP-ML(Q) lifecycle, we ensure security is embedded in every phase of your AI model development, from Business and Data Understanding to Monitoring and Maintenance.
Our Approach
Our AI Security Assessment Service follows a structured methodology aligned with the CRISP-ML(Q) lifecycle and informed by MITRE ATLAS:

Business and Data UnderstandingWe define your AI system’s objectives and identify potential threat scenarios, mapping them to ATLAS tactics like reconnaissance or model access.

Data EngineeringWe assess training data for vulnerabilities, such as poisoning risks, and implement mitigations like data validation and sanitization.

Machine Learning Model EngineeringWe evaluate model architecture and weights for white-box vulnerabilities, using ATLAS techniques to simulate attacks like functional extraction.

Quality AssuranceWe conduct rigorous testing, including red teaming with ATLAS case studies (e.g., ChatGPT Plugin Privacy Leak), to validate model robustness.

DeploymentWe secure digital access points (e.g., APIs) and physical access points, mitigating risks like prompt injection or real-world data manipulation.

Monitoring and MaintenanceWe implement continuous monitoring to detect data drift, concept drift, or adversarial attacks, revisiting earlier phases as needed to address emerging threats.


Key Features

Comprehensive Threat Modeling: Using ATLAS’s 14 tactics and 82 techniques, we assess risks across AI Access Time (training and inference), AI Access Points (digital and physical), and System Knowledge (white-box to black-box).
Real-World Insights: Our assessments draw on ATLAS case studies, such as PoisonGPT, to simulate realistic attack scenarios and develop targeted mitigations.
Regulatory Compliance: We ensure alignment with standards like GDPR and HIPAA, leveraging ATLAS to address data privacy and security requirements.
Customized Mitigation Strategies: Tailored recommendations for each CRISP-ML(Q) phase, from secure data pipelines to runtime threat detection.

Benefits

Proactive Risk Management: Identify and mitigate AI-specific vulnerabilities before they are exploited.
Enhanced System Resilience: Build robust AI systems that withstand adversarial attacks.
Compliance Assurance: Meet regulatory requirements with confidence.
Cost Savings: Reduce the financial impact of security breaches by addressing risks early.
